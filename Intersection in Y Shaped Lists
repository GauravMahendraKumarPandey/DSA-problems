Intersection in Y Shaped Lists (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/intersection-point-in-y-shapped-linked-lists/1)

You are given the heads of two non-empty singly linked lists, head1 and head2, that intersect at a certain point. Return that Node where these two linked lists intersect.
Note: It is guaranteed that the intersected node always exists.
In the custom input you have to give input for CommonList which pointed at the end of both head1 and head2 to form a Y-shaped linked list.

Examples:
Input: head1: 10 -> 15 -> 30, head2: 3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 15 -> 30
Output: 15
Explanation: From the above image, it is clearly seen that the common part is 15 -> 30, whose starting point is 15.

Input: head1: 4 -> 1 -> 8 -> 5, head2: 5 -> 6 -> 1 -> 8 -> 5
Output: 1
Explanation: From the above image, it is clearly seen that the common part is 1 -> 8 -> 5, whose starting point is 1.


Solution:
class Solution:
    def intersectPoint(self, head1, head2):
        p1, p2 = head1, head2
        while p1 is not p2:
            p1 = p1.next if p1 else head2
            p2 = p2.next if p2 else head1
        return p1
